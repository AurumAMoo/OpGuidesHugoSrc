"Witch! Witch! What just because I wear fucking dark clothes, like growing herbs, have had pre-marital sex, and don't like their silly little Sunday sing along hour doesn't mean I'm a God damned witch"

"Mm," Abbey tried to speak, as sala dripped off her tortilla chip onto the table "I dunno Bree, I think you had to have done something magical when you made this," she held up her chip, making even more sala drip off "devine tomato based dip"

"Sal-Sa. It's Sala Abs. I swear you're the kind of person who goes into a bar and orders hopps flavored liquid."

"And so what if I am, bee-otch. Speaking of, why don't we go down to Jack's and get some of that happy juice."

"Sounds good to me, I could stand to blow off some steam."

--

It was half past 11 when we got to the Jack's and despite being a bouncer, the asshat out front happend to be one of the bible thumpin' wackos from St. What-the-fucks that had been on Bree's case. Now, normally at a bar like Jacks the two of us blend in enough with the low lives and drunkerds to not get to much hassle, but oh-fucking-no not tonight.

"Oh hey there little witch. Sorry, you need to be at least this-"

He pinched his finger and thub together so the tips were very close to touching

"normal to enter. No witches allowed."

"Fuck off dude. Come on Abs, let's find a different hole in the wall since these guys have their bibles 7 inches into their rectums apparently"

"What the fuck is up with you being called a witch anyway?"

"I haven't the slightest clue! Like I said, I don't go to their Jesus Club, but I'm also not out here brewing things in cast iron coldrons or collecting black cats."

"Well, why not?"

"I am *not* a cat person."

"Well, if they're so bothered by it, why not stick it to them? Be a witch. Fight the patriarchy. Show them that you're a beautiful onion with many layers."

"That's an ogre... You know what. Fuck it. Let's do it. Kristina has been trying to get me to come over anyway. Based on the constant smell of incense and her sleves of celtic knots she's gotta be in on something we're not, right?"

--

░ME░ Yo, sorry to text out of the blue, you busy?

Never be sorry to text me. What's up? ▓Kristina▓

░ME░ Looking piss off some old white guys

FUCK YEH. LESS GOOOO ▓Kristina▓

░ME░ You do any witch-y shit?

I am witch-y shit incarnate ▓Kristina▓

░ME░ Wanna go all Hex Girls on these dicks?

When? ▓Kristina▓

░ME░ Now?

Ah, fuck it. Why not. Come over. Bring some of your herbs. Being grown in little gardens makes them work better anyway. ▓Kristina▓

░ME░ Work better?

Look, I don't fuck around with wich-y shit. I do it right. Bring an open mind and make sure you have plenty of Thyme. ▓Kristina▓

░ME░ Was that a pun?

Get your ass over here. ▓Kristina▓

We stopped home and Abs immediately passed went to the couch, started muching on more salsa, and got enthralled in a random episode of Supernatural. I grabbed Thyme, Rosemary, and some Poppy seeds, hopped in my 2010 Impalla that was currently covered in bird shit, and headed over to Kristina's. On the drive I tried to think witchy thoughts. Mostly I just felt like I was imating a high dude "Like, what if all the Gods are real, duuuude. Duudddeee." I did feel a bit more motivated thinking about the idea of having a mother godess looking over me right now, thinking "Fuck yeah, that's my girl!" as she watches me.

As I pulled up to Kristina's around midnight she came outside in a silky night gown and hugged me. When we cut off our embrace she stuck her tounge out at me and said "I knew you'd want to kick some ass eventually, you little witch. Come on in, the covens all here."

The. What.

As I entered three other girls were sitting cross legged. They were talking, but I didn't make out any of the conversation before they all stopped to look at me.

After a painfully awkward moment, Kristina said "Bree, the Coven - Ash, Madi, and Clair - Coven, Bree."

"So this is the witch you were talking about! Damn, we see what you meant. I could feel her before she got to the door!" Madi said.

"Feel me?"

"Oh, ignore her." Kristia said as much to me as she did to Madi, the tone said "shut up" more than words could.

"You've been talking about me?"

"Ugh. Look. You're a witch. I don't mean this as in a euphamism for bitch or as in you're one of us. I mean it as in you were born a witch. You've got power in you, Bree. I've met others like you - the three of them in that circle there are the ones I got the chance to show. But you're something else. It's like we're all double A's and you're a god damn power line. When you're in tune with it, you stand out like crazy."

"That's a, uh, lot."

"I know it sounds crazy. Before you go 'But I'm not the chosen one' or some shit just try this. Chan't with us, please. If you feel something, anything, stay."

I felt my heart. I felt everything. I could feel the other witches, their power. I could feel my ancestors, the witches before me. I could feel their struggles with prejudice, their losses from prejucide against them as nature people. And so naked I walked on the mud, the room tranfromed before me. I came to flowing water, a river filled with life. In the sounds of the woods, the waters, and the sky I heard the message of a mother goddes. She said "The ones that hurt you, deprived of their nature connection, you must love them tonight."

And so I found them. I brought their souls into mine. First the ones that judged me, called me what I am. Then more and more, until the entire world shared my mind. It was then I gave my power, though it was really never mine. I showed them the love of a mother goddes, Gaia shared with us her time.

And so I am a witch, but made them one in kind.

## Today's Poem

<pre>
If by chance, you are reading this
It's not without a digital kiss
Though ethernet and Wi-Fi
In ASCII I tell you lies
I convince you though pixels
Sent over rolling hills
That this is real
</br>
Do not fear, reality isn't everything
In VR we can be anything
Confident, couragous. 
Cautious? Outragous.
There is no danger, nothing to fear.
If you grab my hand, I will take you there.
