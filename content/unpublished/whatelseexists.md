# What Else Exists?

I'm a firm believer that an important part of problem solving and innovating development is connecting ideas from other, seemingly unrelated fields. Really just pick any two niche interests and try to combine them. To put my money where my mouth is, here's three quick projects:

* Cryptography and Fractals?
* Generative music and slime mold simulation?
* Domain specific

Things not in this generator:

* Most non-technical things. In this context, a random generation involving a specific famous person or historic event isn't really useful.
* Most things that would require using harsh chemicals
