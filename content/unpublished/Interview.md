**08/26/2021**

<!-- This document is wirtten in a format called markdown. If you've never seen it before, that's fine. The gist is all the formatting is done in the text itself. Text with **two asterics** around it is bold, *one* is italic, and the things with less than and greater than signs and dashes you see here are comments that won't appear in the final page. if you want a link just do [link text in the square brackets](https://actuallLinkHere.com). If you really want to go nuts, you can technically mix in html too, so things like YouTube or Twitter embeds work too. If you want to put in a table, fancy math, colums of text, pictures, or footnotes let me know and I'll get that done for you. -->

<!-- I'd like to have at least one image to represent either you or your channel to put at the top, so if you could send me something to put there that you have full permision to let me embed on my site that would be lovely. -->

<!-- I've used the name Annie here, but if you'd rather I just make it "Sex Positive Gaming" everywhere, that's fine-->

<!-- if there are any questions you prefer not to answer, that's fine! Just put comment tags like this around the question. -->
