# Making a VRChat World

## Step 1: What Do I Want? What Do I ùïüùï†ùï• want.

concept art, etc.

**Want:**

* ALIVE. Things should feel alive - wind, movement, player-reactivity
* LIVED IN. Each area should feel like there have been people there. Papers around, things under study, etc.
* SOUND. Ambient environment should have original sounds from my modular, kalimba, talkbox, guitars, etc.
* SYTLIZED. The world should be **big** so poly counts need to be low and/or have LOD.
* SCALE. The world should be big enough to feel epic
* BEST OF NATURE. Crystals, Caves, hexagon beaches, vines, moss, rainbow mountains, waterfalls, shelf-mushrooms, slime mold, multiple moons, ring around planet, bio-luminescence
  * Some periodic/random events
* EXPOSED. Wiring, edison lights, steam-punk-ish

**Don't:**

* HARD MOVEMENT. No spiral stairs/things that are annoying to navigate in VR
  * If for style they must be there, buttons to act as teleporters
    * Ideally, no stairs at all. Portal-sytle faith plates are way more fun.
* OVERDONE SHADERS.
  * I want to do shader dev for this, I don't want to make it look overdone.
* LOUD. Things should be quiet enough that it's fine to talk and hang out
