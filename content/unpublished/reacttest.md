# React test

https://josem.co/how-to-render-a-react-component-in-hugo/ - I'd like to get https://mafs.dev/guides/get-started/installation working, but I'm not sure it's possible to do so in a convenient way with Hugo. I'm really not a fan of adding react as a depedency and using that much JS anyway, but if this works it'd be worth it.
