# Religion



<img src="/memes/gods.webp" alt="American Gods Quote" style="float: right;width:40%;padding:10px">

Religion is, shocker, a deeply personal thing. 

Maybe you're of the oppinion that you're following the One True Good‚Ñ¢. </br>Maybe you think that everyone is crazy with their belief in imaginary friends.</br> Maybe you think all of humanity is just a sort of womb for a new god.</br>Maybe you think all the gods are real, and made from the belief of their followers.</br> Maybe you just don't give a üí©</br> Maybe you give a üí© some days, think it's all a bunch of üêÇüí© others.

Ultimately, as long as it is a personal thing and you keep it a personal thing, which camp you fall in to doesn't really matter. Unfortuantely,

* Most religions view spreading the Word Of God‚Ñ¢ as a key thing.
* Religion is becoming increasing tied to politicial ideology.
* Religion is often used to justify doing some really shit things
* Religion has the ability to make shit things done previously (often 500+ years ago) keep people very, very angry
  * This anger is often used by those with ulterior motives
* *Most* religions are predatory on those that fear death

Now, depeding on who you are - which, if you're on my website, I can make some good assumptions that you're probably a young, middle-class, technically incliend person, and probably either atheist or at least not-Christian - you may be thinking "Why do I care? Those old white guys have their views, I have mine. Can't change it."

Well, the professional, nerdy community (engineers, programmers, etc.) is strangely divided, the 'old guard' is largely relatively conservative and religious, but as time has moved forward the younger generation taking these positions are largely liberal and not religous at all. If you're going to interact with these people, it helps to know how they think and how to identify the bullshit and call it out in a productive manner. Similarly, if you're a conservative christian (and you're still reading - which, wow, thank you, I'm glad you're putting up with my jabs. I hope you do actually take my perspectives and think on them, even if you don't agree with any when you're done.) I suspect this will help you see the "other side".

Furthermore, while religion itself is largely separated enough from technical fields as to not matter, politics is not. And the right wing is nothing if not united from Religion.

Hell, even if single issue voters only chose their canidates because "Abortion = bad!", the same representatives are largely repsonible for legislation has negatively impacting copyright law, access to information, what is allowed to be distributed on a platform, funding for reaseach and devolpment (notably in aerospace), policy for renewable energy, and the prolification of techgiants which stiffle competition, and freedom of speech/moderation online. So, even if you don't give a shit directly, the knock on effects will matter to you.

Finally, it would probably be worth your time to look into basics of most world religions, as nerdy, professional positions are increasingly held on a global field where you will have no choice but to work with people from diverse backgrounds across the globe.

## Spreading The Word

If you push you're regilion on **ANYONE** you're an ass. It doesn't matter if you're trying to "Save their soul". You may *think* it's harmless and you're helping them not spend eternity in Hell. Well, it's not harmless. Why?

1. The person you're talking to may be a part of a group a large portion of your religion hates (LGBT, Liberal, etc.)
2. The person you're talking to (or their family/friends) may already be of religion that has had past reasons to be fearful of your relgion - Witch hunts, anyone?

Now, you *personally* may not dislike the person for who they are, hell, maybe you are LGBT or whatever along side them. Great! Then you know full well why they may be disinterested and should respect that.

Similarly, you *personally* probably haven't gone on any Witch hunts or killed a million Jews. Again, sure, but ya' think that *maybe* someone might hold a bit of a grudge for their incestors pain? Again, all it takes to respect that is to - and I can't state this enough - shut the fuck up.

Finally, maybe you have kids and think "I had a GREAT time in the Church, I want them to experiance that too!" - I'm sure they would have a great time. Missions are AWESOME {{< spoiler >}}(for the people going on them, significantly less so for the places they go){{< /spoiler >}} and it's a tight nit social group. Great, until your son realizes  *oh, that boy over there is kind of cute*, and then feels repulsed by his own feelings, talks to a religious leader, supresses those feelings, then winds up in the hospital when he uses an object not made to go in his ass for anal play because he's to ashamed to buy a butt plug.

And, hell, maybe that's what you want. Maybe you think that shame is God's way of baking morals into us. I'm sure a large portion of the people in India would tell you the same about eating Beef.

All of this amplified when you consider just how completely horrific and adult most religions are. Have you READ the bible? This isn't a book for Kids. Hell, even the centrol story of Christianity - nailing some dude to a cross -  is already pretty fucked up. So, naturally, lets have them re-enact it in a little play. I'm *sure* that won't end in some kid being actually nailed to a cross by his friends some day.

This isn't meant to be an attack on Chiristianity. Wicca? Satanism? Budism? I don't care what you're going with, it probably has some pretty adult things in there

Okay, wait, I see you opening another tab and googling "child christinan indoctrination" - so let's look at one of the first results, helpfulily from [focusonthefamily.com](https://www.focusonthefamily.com/family-qa/religious-indoctrination-of-children/), I'm sure that's a fair, unbiassed source. Let's just skip to the bottom, shall we:

{{< quote "[Focus on The Family](https://www.focusonthefamily.com/family-qa/religious-indoctrination-of-children/)" >}}

Here‚Äôs the bottom line: if you hold back from fulfilling your spiritual responsibilities as a parent out of some vague fear of ‚Äúindoctrinating‚Äù your kids, you‚Äôll only be doing them a huge disservice. Moms and dads who withhold instruction from their children and allow them to ‚Äúdecide for themselves‚Äù what they‚Äôre going to believe are almost guaranteeing that they‚Äôll ‚Äúdecide‚Äù to turn away from the faith and embrace ‚Äúwhat seems right in their own eyes‚Äù **(Judges 21:25).** That‚Äôs a mistake you don‚Äôt want to make.

{{< /quote >}}

Wait, hold up? Did this **actually** just site the book I'm saying is used for indoctrination saying "nah, it's fine, really!" as their source? You think a cult *wouldn't* be constantly putting messages that say "Not a cult, we pinky promise!" in all of their reading material? Moreover, this literally says that people wouldn't come to Christianity on their own. So... someone who goes out of their way to reseach and look into information, explore alternatives, etc. isn't going to **decide** (willing choose to) join the religion? That sure sounds like "Teach your kids Christianity early, or they might try other things and realize it's üêÇüí©"* to me.

{{< smalltext >}}\* again, I'm not saying this just about Christianity, it's just the easy target being the biggest religion in the world. Plus, I feel less bad painting it a bad light given its size. Furthermore, talking vaguely about all religions makes this much harder to write.{{< /smalltext >}}

Also, in case it wasn't obvious when I joked about it being a biased source, the website literally ends with a phone number to call a pastoral counselor.

Okay, what about the 2nd result on Google is [Journey Free: Recovery from Harmful Religion](https://journeyfree.org/childhood-religious-indoctrination/), which, uhh, hmm. Boy, I wonder if that might be written by someone with a chip on their shoulder. This page agruees Christian children will experiance developmental delays and constantly have rucrring trauma as they fear Hell. Sure, there's maybe some really extreme Chirstian groups that are this bad, but you're normal Church probably won't do this either.

So, is there an actual, reaseached moderate view? Well, clearly I'm not the guy to write that. But I did find [The Psychological Processes and Consequences of Fundamentalist Indoctrination by Josh Cuevas](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/57163304/Essays_in_the_Philosophy_of_Humanism-with-cover-page-v2.pdf?Expires=1658095582&Signature=L8Rsm93Ao2wT9LBom3XTFJkGUy71wt0Pi8ACK4P69Ki4IPKESkSsejnyeyMAlco-pG7Juf5ATbbx48C~~FsfD6FW-U4YseeyvGA3iN-VEjRM0YtFfm8ItCbuNijJRkuTPqaN9ts80ei4sDbb~P3VEqGmUUXNLi~Q-YtbICmBqabX5pSHAqyx~RlLUzoOYOYedlwIyvmWU2sivrKTTCvyaQ~sjNEm4AlcBsQcPC9SBPvDCTzV5ebwgiMhLW2sbGDDMAXYEoD8DGzsJz5TYCLWxUNny9qZtm~wVMKFlYOEXsCvBYewL2MIpVorXT8uDjT6hw~Mn36tfjfJQiNbYPWhjw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA), a professor at the University of North Georgia. Which as TL;DR basically agrees that at least religious education is indoctrination "because it asks the child to bypass reason and evidence, and instead accept something as truth that is not known to be true by the authority figure." and that "This also creates greater possibilities for extremism and violence.", though, really, go read at least the Conclusion (only 8 paragraphs) for yourself. It also helpfully mentions how Islamic communties are affected as well.

### ~~Death~~ Religion & Taxes

## Justiying Shit Things



## Historical üí©iness Drives Hate

From the Inquisitions to 9/11 and School Shootings; from largely supported actions to rouge actors, religion is used to justify shit things. That isn't going to stop any time soon. Each of those shit things may be a tragedy in its own right. But they also add up to people seeing eachother as the enemy. This isn't just from one religious group to another either: The Left‚Ñ¢ is increasingly seeing not just The Right‚Ñ¢ as an enemy, but the religious organizations - Mostly Christian - that under pin it.

Hell, if you're Liberal you probably just went "Well, yeah. Those bastards took away Abortion access, try to ban books, ..."

If you're Christian you probably thought "See! You see us, and our views, as bad!"

Now, I could try to take the moderate view here and say "See, both sides have a different perspective." But, yunno', fuck that, it's my website and I'm not going to sugar coat it: Yeah, if you're trying to ban abortion and books, make trans people use the wrong restroom, and voted for a guy that brags about his past sexual assults, well, you're the asshole. If you're a Christian and go to Church with people that do this and don't call it out, you're **still** the asshole.

If this is the first time this is ocurring to you, well, you could probably stand to whatch a mix of videos from everything from [Philosophy Tube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2PA-AKmVpU6NKCGtZq_rKQ), [Zoo Bee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVX6G_5H-LU), [Innuendo Studios](https://www.youtube.com/c/InnuendoStudios), [AntiCitizen X](https://www.youtube.com/c/AntiCitizenX), and [TMM](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMessianicManic); read [A Sick Giant](https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/01/sick-giant.html); and talk to some people about how religion has been used to make their lives worse... And you really really need to hear this: Ben  üëè Shapiro üëè isüëè a üëè fucking üëè moron üëè. {{< smalltext >}}And Tucker Carlson is a racist.{{< /smalltext >}}

The problem is, you may be in full agreement with me and be going "YASS QUEEEN" at your screen, and it doesn't fucking matter if we can't talk to people get them to realize they've been indoctrinated into spreading hate. 

Unfortunately, it's often not enough to point out that something is hateful, as they'll agruee they're doing it out of love. Usually something like "I love you, so I want to save your soul" or similar. Helping them understand that
