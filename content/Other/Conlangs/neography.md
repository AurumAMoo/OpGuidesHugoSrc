I would like to exchange information with you about the exchange of information. If you would like to continue this information transaction please continue scanning these symbols with your eyeballs and interpreting them in the language you think they are meant to encode using your past knowledge and cultural context.

I already have a page on this website about {{< button relref="Other/conlangs/tokipona" >}} toki pona {{< /button >}} , one **con**structed **lan**guage or "conlang" that I particularly enjoy. Being in its community, I've been introduced to many interesting ideas in the conlang and the adjacent **con**structed **scripts** (conscript) communities. 

{{< smalltext >}}Also sometimes called "neoscript", I assume to avoid the existing usage of the term meaning to enlist in the armed services{{< /smalltext >}}

In these communities, I have seen some absolutely crazy shit:

[Burgerscript here]

Of course, most of what's on display here isn't this ridiculous (or frankly low effort). Some of these conscripts are for conlangs - fully new languages that need their own writing system as no existing system would even work.

Some only make new symbols for existing alphabets - yes, like BurgerScript - 

Some dramatically challenge the idea of what it means to "write" something. 

Some are used for building a world and culture in a fictional story - like Elvish in Lord Of The Rings

Some as a form of artistic expression, 

Some in an attempt to make a writing system that [fits an existing language better](https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/finnishscript.htm) than system used today. 

Some are made to allow for sharing or concealing messages in mediums that wouldn't normally be thought of as places thoughts could be recorded at all.

So, let's look at some scripts, what makes them interesting, and talk about what we can learn from them.

To get started, I want to look at scripts that have particularly interesting applications - that is, scripts which exist because the typical writing systems don't work well for their applications

* https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hexcasting (or https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/gridika.htm or https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/gernreich.htm)
* Nail Script
* https://omniglot.com/conscripts/pixelscript.htm (or https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/kfg.htm)

There's some that are well suited to hiding messages

* https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/baduk.htm
* Mention steganography as a whole

Intriguingly, some use an existing language, but instead of just mapping the letters to new symbols change the way  we think about a 'character' all together. Of these, I particularly like [fontok](https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/fontok.htm) which adds a significant number of characters as each *sound* (not character) in English is given its own symbol.

Next, I'd like to look at some scripts that stood out to me as having a strong "for non-humans this would be good" flavor,

* https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/scar.htm
* https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/12480.htm

In programming, there's this idea of domain specific languages. These are programming languages that don't really do everything - instead they do one thing really well. The most famous two are regex and SQL. I think you can apply that idea can apply in other niches too. If you think about *speech* vs *writing* vs *signing* vs *braille* and how each can have multiple co-existing (or competing) standards / systems, it's really not a stretch 

* Rhapsodaic (emotions)

But, I do want to wrap back around to that programming idea briefly. There are some programming languages that are pretty radically different in the way we input and output information, so while they may not be "writing systems" in the traditional sense, I think they're worth a look in this list.



If you're into DSLs,

Ligatures? Old school ascii art fonts. Emoji + unicode, Visual programming (node based)





Within the realm of what we'd still call language, there's some I want to showcase just for being beautiful

Finally, there's some really, really bizzare ones I want to mention

Orca + that hex one



{{< speech triode >}}

Okay, but, what about Emoji? ü§î

{{< /speech >}}

Well, yeah, they're a writing system. They may not be incredibly precise if the exact symbol you need doesn't exist, but they can be rather information dense. 

üëîüíºüîúüè†üëâüëå üë®‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë® üçëüçÜ‚ùì

Is a pretty clear message.

I think the better question is, where do you draw the line? Personally, I think the definition of what should be considered language should be pretty board. It clearly includes this text itself and most of the writing systems above. It obviously includes speech, braille, sign language (it's, uh, in the name), and I think most would agree that both math and music constitute "language"

{{< columns3 >}}

{{< katex >}}

x = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1+ \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \cfrac{1}{a_4} } } }

{{< /katex >}}

</br></br>

{{< smalltext >}}{{< button relref="Engineering/WrappingUp/latex" >}}{{< katex >}}\LaTeX{{< /katex >}}{{< /button >}} was used to format this math, it's pretty much the language for typesetting math digitally.{{< /smalltext >}}

<--->

{{< smalltext >}}[SMuFL](https://www.smufl.org/fonts/) is used to display this music on the web - it's basically just a really clever way of (ab)using fonts.{{< /smalltext >}}

{{< /columns3 >}}

Now, this isn't to say there aren't some definitional lines. I don't think I'd consider a video a language - a medium on which multiple different languages can be expressed, sure - but not a language itself. Where I think the line is significantly more blurry, espically as you dive into data visualization and interactive content.

Plus, those - like the {{< katex >}}\LaTeX{{< /katex >}} above - have the fun of being a language which is has another language used to write it. I don't think that disqualifies them as languages (or at least writing systems) after all, if you have Google Translate translate something from English to Spanish, (and it works) it's not as if we think of the result as just "modified English" - it's Spanish.

Yet, there is still some fun to be had in this line of thought. If I type out 

"Hello World"

That string of text is being stored, transferred across the great series of tubes, and being understood by your computer as Binary. Does that make binary - or any base for that matter - it's own language? What if we display it in an interesting way like Hobbits does:



Does showing an audio spectogram qualify as a writing system? I think it can. Someone trained to do so could absolutely look at waveform or spectogram of a recording to understand what was being said.

This quickly devolves into interpreting encodings as their own "language" which, like, I *guessssss* could have an argument made for, but it's a stretch. Still, I think there's value in the metaphor, and especially for the technically inclined, thinking about encodings and APIs as forms of communication and taking inspiration from the conlang and conscript community can only stand to bring about clever, innovative ideas in storage, compressing, representation, and elegance. I think that's worth being open to. But lets come back to that - 

{{< speech triode >}}

What about fonts?

{{< /speech >}}

Note on fonts being this but baby steps, with some being pretty wild - espically with ligatures

Music fonts... I forgot what these are called.

tools of communication - keyboards, hand gestures, voice, graphs, braille, etc. What weird ones exist?

Encodings

How does this tie in to the current AI boom

How does culture affect things- meme culture vs business culture. Expectactions of attention span. Goals: Persausion and adversion to it.

Art - espically obviously political pieces? Music performance?

Arrival movie + secret handshakes

Both the Zoia and Maestro effectively have their own language

## What happens as we push boundaries

### Completely new forms of expression

* Orca
* Rhapsodaic

### Radically enhanced expressiveness

* Geometry nodes

### More powerful tools

* Open SCAD
* Regex

### Easier to understand standards

* The music ones

### Inteopability

The ORCA + Ronin + etc system (+ their themes)

### Better exploration of data and connection

* The Hyperlink + Obsidian
* https://docs.kanaries.net/rath/explore-data/data-painter
  * link to Computers Suck section about making web data exposed and rendered locally 

## Why are we **not** pushing boundaries?

* Our input methods have become relatively static (keyboards and the keys on them)
* Our systems are designed for rendering plain ass text and have a hard time with implied style (AST aware syntax highlighting, language servers)
* Legacy compatability - show Arcan/Lash/Cat9
* 

Simple, Fast, Expressive, Style points (does it look good)

Before we wrap up, I want to say there's an *insane* number of scripts I was unable to link here that I thought were more than deserving of being featured. It's also notable that the only language I speak fluently is English, so my ability to even appreciate the scripts and conlangs more heavily rooted in other cultures is significantly more limited. This has lead me to not feature any of the beautiful scripts that are heavily inspired by existing, natural Arabic, Asian, or braille scripts. If you'd like to see more, I highly encourage you to dive into this yourself and take a stroll though the conscript world without my biases filtering it.
