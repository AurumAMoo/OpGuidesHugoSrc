# A review of Emergent Drums

Before I can say anything else, I need to point out that the devs are ludicrously responsive. Every flaw I've found so far has been acknowledged, ever suggestion recognized, and support unreasonably fast...

... *That said*, the plugin is, well, rought.

In my first few minutes:

* I muted a drum and absolutely could not tell because the GUI lacked constrast

* Found it annoying that I couldn't solo a drum

* Found a bug where moving the sample start point caused the pitch to rise

* Found a """bug""" where sample start/end points don't snap to 0-crossings, causing clicks

* Got confused by the octaves on the GUI not matching those of the note data sent it*

  \* To be fair, this appears to be an issue with DAWs not being consistent in what to consider middle C

* Found that short triggers would cause the pad not to light up visually

* Found a bug where many, many unused VST parameters (thousands) are exposed to the DAW
