# ? - Making Something

As I'm writing these, it's occurring to me I'm really leaving out the practical. If somebody really wants to lean how to do electornics stuff, even at the hobbiest level, they need to be able to 

* Know how to pick parts
* Know how and where to order parts
* How to actually assemble things (a bit of mechincial know-how)
* Feel comfortable making things that do things

Beginner projects then are a bit of a problem. Doing it Shu Ha Ri style, we need something to start with to just blindly follow (Shu) and get a taste for it. The problem is, most options at this stage pretty much suck for either being

* useless (solder practice boards)
* Too difficult (anything SMD to start)
* Not modern (no micro controllers)
  * Yes, this conflicts with the no SMD to begin with
* Too... general â†’ people want to make something they're actually passionate about.

To fix this, I want to come up with a list op options for first projects that range across intrerests, a "why you should care" for each (cost, not available commercially, freedom to make something personal, etc.).

So far, the best bet I've found is Guitar pedals from PedalPCB and parts from StompBoxParts & Digikey.

Ideals:

* Guitar pedals from PedalPCB and parts from StompBoxParts & Digikey.
  * Alt. Eurorack
* Retro computing?
* RC Cars/Drones?
* Atari punk console and start a rack for using synths to teach electronics? This could also still be a pedal and hook it into synth later?
  * I might make an OSHW eurorack variant that's maximally cheap for OpGuides
