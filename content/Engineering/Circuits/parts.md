# 24Â½ - Parts

When thinking about electronics, it's easy to focus on the bits that electricity actually flows though. This chapter is for everything else

## Part Codes

Okay, sort of still electrically relevant, but as your peruse your options for parts you'll see some patterns in how things are named, such as diodes starting with a **1N** prefix. If you want to know more about that, these links are decent:

## Enclosures



## Adhesives



## Adapters

\+ PCB footprint adapters, like SOP to DIP

## Wires

Stranded, enamaled, etc.

## Buttons

## Switches

SPST DPST etc

## Encoders

vs a pot, w/ a button
