[TODO] **literally this entire page is TODO**. I'm just making it as a place to dump links for now. Eventually I'd like to talk about why most interview processes suck, the high no-response rate, certifications vs degree, how to write a résumé, cover letter, start up culture, non-compete clauses, fake glassdoor listings, Linked in BS, all the things.

THIS WILL NOT BE A PLACE TO LINK TO SPECIFIC JOBS. DO NOT EVEN TRY TO SUBMIT A PR WITH THAT.

[TODO] NEVER, EVER sign a contract that says your employer owns all of your work from outside of work
